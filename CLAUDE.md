# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tamamo is a Slack bot application built with Go, using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture principles. It provides an AI-powered assistant through Slack integration.

## Restrictions and Rules

### Directory

- When you are mentioned about `tmp` directory, you SHOULD NOT see `/tmp`. You need to check `./tmp` directory from root of the repository.

### Exposure policy

In principle, do not trust developers who use this library from outside

- Do not export unnecessary methods, structs, and variables
- Assume that exposed items will be changed. Never expose fields that would be problematic if changed
- Use `export_test.go` for items that need to be exposed for testing purposes

### Check

When making changes, before finishing the task, always:
- Run `go vet ./...`, `go fmt ./...` to format the code
- Run `golangci-lint run ./...` to check lint error
- Run `gosec -exclude-generated -quiet ./...` to check security issue
- Run `go test ./...` to check side effect

### Language

All comment and character literal in source code must be in English

### Testing

- Test files should have `package {name}_test`. Do not use same package name
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULE: Test MUST be included in same name test file. (e.g. test for `abc.go` must be in `abc_test.go`) ðŸš¨**

### Slack Responses
- **All Slack responses MUST be sent as thread replies (with thread_ts)**
- Never send messages to the channel directly unless explicitly required

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Testing
- `go build` - Build the main binary
- `go test ./...` - Run all tests
- `go test ./pkg/path/to/package` - Run tests for specific package
- `task` - Run default tasks (mock generation)
- `task mock` (alias: `task m`) - Generate all mock files

### Code Generation
- `go install github.com/matryer/moq@latest` - Install moq for mock generation
- `moq -out pkg/domain/mock/interfaces.go ./pkg/domain/interfaces SlackClient` - Generate mocks

## Important Development Guidelines

### Error Handling
- Use `github.com/m-mizutani/goerr` for error handling
- Must wrap errors with `goerr.Wrap` to maintain error context
- Add helpful variables with `goerr.With` for debugging

### Testing
- Use `github.com/m-mizutani/gt` package for type-safe testing
- Test files should have `package {name}_test`. Do not use same package name
- **Test MUST be included in same name test file. (e.g. test for `abc.go` must be in `abc_test.go`)**
- Use mock implementations from `pkg/domain/mock` generated by moq

### Code Visibility
- Do not expose unnecessary methods, variables and types
- Use `export_test.go` to expose items needed only for testing

## Architecture

### Core Structure
The application follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with clean architecture:

- `pkg/domain/` - Domain layer with business logic, interfaces, and models
- `pkg/service/` - Application services implementing business operations
- `pkg/controller/` - Interface adapters (HTTP, Slack)
- `pkg/usecase/` - Application use cases orchestrating domain operations
- `pkg/cli/` - CLI command processing

### Key Components

#### Slack Integration
- `/hooks/slack/events` - Slack event webhook endpoint
- `/hooks/slack/interaction` - Slack interaction endpoint (future)
- Thread-based message replies
- Signature verification for security

#### Path Structure
```
/hooks/               # External service webhooks
  /slack/
    /events           # Slack events
    /interaction      # Slack interactions (future)
/api/                 # REST API (future)
/graphql              # GraphQL (future)
/                     # Frontend static files (future)
```

### Key Interfaces
- `interfaces.SlackClient` - Slack API client abstraction
- `interfaces.SlackEventUseCases` - Slack event handling use cases

## Configuration

The application is configured via CLI flags or environment variables:
- Slack OAuth token (`--slack-oauth-token` or `TAMAMO_SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN`)
- Slack signing secret (`--slack-signing-secret` or `TAMAMO_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`)
- Server address (`--addr` or `TAMAMO_ADDR`)

## Testing

Test files follow Go conventions (`*_test.go`). The codebase includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with mock dependencies
- Mock generation using `moq` tool managed by Taskfile
